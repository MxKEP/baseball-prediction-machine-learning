Using Machine Learning to Predict Base Hits in Baseball

As the game of baseball adapts to the information age, it becomes increasingly reliant on
analytical and statistical methods in order to maintain a competitive edge. Predictive models in
the MLB are useful and highly sought after by teams, coaches, and the sports betting industry. In
this paper I will use classification-based machine learning techniques with the aim of predicting
the result of an at-bat, whether it be an out or a hit, by using information about the pitch.
Classification will be done using a Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, and a Deep Neural Network. The models will then be evaluated and
compared to each other. Previous researchers have had success with these machine learning
methods, so my goal is to find out if they perform comparably well when applied to the problem
of predicting at-bat results.
